# Purpose
GreenView is a mobile application which allows users to scan objects and determine their recyclability.

# The Problem
Pollution is a growing problem in the world, especially in the majority of cities in the United States. The increasing rate of pollution has led to the release of dioxins or pollutants from burning trash (plastic, paper, glass, etc.). Dioxins lead to air, water, and soil pollution, which is detrimental to environmental sustainability and human health. The overall purpose of the GreenView app is to reduce the amount of waste and increase efforts in recycling.

# Technologies
We utilized a full-stack development environment by utilizing both front and backend development of the mobile application. The client-side of the mobile app is with XML activities and Java programming within the Android Studios IDE (integrated development environment). Furthermore, we utilized Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Animate to create a variety of electronic graphics designs. In addition, the mobile application also integrated a variety of APIs (application programming interfaces). Some APIs include the Facebook Login API, the Facebook Graph API, and the Clairifai API. In terms of server-side, we used MySQL for a database system and integrated PHP with the database to call for data between the Java client and the PHP server.
